entity BrakeLights is-- setting up the input and output nodes. you have to add the brakes in this code
	port (LeftBlinker, RightBlinker, Brake, Clock: in bit; L1, L2, L3, R1, R2, R3: out bit);
end BrakeLights;

architecture Behaviour of BrakeLights is
begin
--All 3 Left lights have the same code as we want them to do the same thing and we treated them as one entity in the kMaps
	L1 <= (RightBlinker AND Brake) OR (NOT(LeftBlinker) AND Brake);
	L2 <= (RightBlinker AND Brake) OR (NOT(LeftBlinker) AND Brake);
	L3 <= (RightBlinker AND Brake) OR (NOT(LeftBlinker) AND Brake);
--All 3 Right lights have the same code as we want them to do the same thing and we treated them as one entity in the kMaps
	R1 <= (LeftBlinker AND Brake) OR (NOT(RightBlinker) AND Brake);
	R2 <= (LeftBlinker AND Brake) OR (NOT(RightBlinker) AND Brake);
	R3 <= (LeftBlinker AND Brake) OR (NOT(RightBlinker) AND Brake);
